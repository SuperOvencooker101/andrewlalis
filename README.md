* [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/), [**MariaDB**](https://mariadb.com/), [**PostGreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Repositories Worth Checking Out
- [TengwarTranslator](https://github.com/andrewlalis/TengwarTranslator) and [TenwarTranslatorLibrary](https://github.com/andrewlalis/TengwarTranslatorLibrary) Simple Java/Swing desktop application which can transform text from ASCII characters to Tengwar (*Tolkien's elvish script*) and back.

  > Note that this <u>isn't</u> translation, but *transliteration*, since we're simply writing English (or whatever language you want) using a different set of characters. It still looks cool though!

  The library can be included in your own project if you want to use the translator without the desktop application.

- [ER-Mapping Editor](https://github.com/andrewlalis/EntityRelationMappingEditor) Editor for creating simple entity-relation mapping diagrams, mostly for use in teaching the concept of Entity-Relational-Mapping to students studying information systems.

- [BlockBookBinder 📕](https://github.com/andrewlalis/BlockBookBinder) Formats and exports large texts into Minecraft books! Basically a fully-automatic printing press that turns pages and pastes content for you.

- [Insights](https://github.com/Java-Discord/InsightsBot) A Discord bot application which you can add to your server to track messages, active user counts, and much more.
