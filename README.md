### Repositories you might find interesting

A hand-picked selection of repositories that stand out as something that might be especially interesting for others, as opposed to some of my more specialized projects.

- [TengwarTranslator](https://github.com/andrewlalis/TengwarTranslator) and [TenwarTranslatorLibrary](https://github.com/andrewlalis/TengwarTranslatorLibrary) If you've ever read *The Lord of the Rings*, you should have at least heard mention of this; *Tengwar* is the script in which several of Tolkien's elvish languages are written. The TengwarTranslator is a simple Java/Swing desktop application which can transform text from ASCII characters to Tengwar and back.

  > Note that this <u>isn't</u> translation, but *transliteration*, since we're simply writing English (or whatever language you want) using a different set of characters. It still looks cool though!

  The library can be included in your own project if you want to use the translator without the desktop application.

- [ImmersiveRailroading-OpenComputers-API](https://github.com/andrewlalis/ImmersiveRailroading-OpenComputers-API) A Spring Boot-based REST API that allows you to interact with computers within your modded Minecraft world, specifically for the purpose of monitoring and controlling railroad locomotives and rolling stock.

- [GithubIssueChecker](https://github.com/andrewlalis/GithubIssueChecker) Simple command-line utility to make checking the issues of a select few repositories easier via the GitHub API.
